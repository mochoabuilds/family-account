# familyaccount

## We build a system used by a household to manage its "weekly tab".  Each member of a household has their own account, all linked to shared account. 
## The system also keeps track of overdue balances and marks the amount owed.  Additional classes mark the overdue amount, current balance, avaliable balance, password validation, simulated scenarios, etc.
